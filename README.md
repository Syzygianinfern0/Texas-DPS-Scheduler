# Texas-DPS-Scheduler
Book Texas DPS Appointments (fixes auth errors) ðŸš¦

## Why?
DPS appointments are pretty much impossible to get and the website is a mess. This script automates the process of booking an appointment. Also, earlier versions of the script were broken due to authentication changes in the DPS website. This version fixes those issues. 

## Usage

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill in the required fields
3. Optionally setup notifications through [Apprise](https://github.com/caronc/apprise) by adding handlers in `monitor.py`
4. Run the following commands

```script
pip install requirements.txt
bash run.sh
```

Tip: You need to keep the script running in order to get an appointment. You can use GitHub Codespaces or a VPS to keep the script running 24/7.

## Project Structure

- `config.example.yaml`: Example configuration file which needs to be copied to `config.yaml`
- `fingerprints.py`: Generates the auth fingerprint for the DPS website
- `main.py`: Main script that checks, holds, and books the appointment
- `monitor.py`: Calls main script periodically and sends notifications
- `run.sh`: Bash script to call the monitor script
